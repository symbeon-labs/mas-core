# 🦅 GP-MAS: symbeon-protocol-mas
**Status**: Alpha Specification  
**Version**: 1.0.0 (Sovereign Primitive)

## 🏛️ 1. Conceptual Framework
GP-MAS is a **Hierarchical Autonomous Agent Swarm (HAAS)** designed for high-integrity threshold attestation. It enables the verification of complex, multi-dimensional reality without compromising the privacy of the underlying data.

### The Problem it Solves
Most decentralized systems rely on single-source data or simple weighted means, which are vulnerable to manipulation ("Greenwashing" or "Data Spoofing"). GP-MAS introduces a **Consensus Trinitário** requirement.

## 📐 2. The Algebraic Foundation (GP-MAS Algebra)
The protocol core is defined by the Sovereign Attestation Score ($S$).

### Quorum Logic
Let $A = \{A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n\}$ be the set of specialized agents.  
Let $s_i \in [0, 100]$ be the individual score from agent $i$.  
Let $v_i \in \{0, 1\}$ be the binary signature of agent $i$.

The **Consensus Score** ($S$) is the arithmetic mean of the active quorum:
$$S = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i \cdot v_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i}$$

**Sovereignty Proof**: $S$ is only valid if the Quorum $Q$ is satisfied:
$$Q \iff \sum v_i \ge \lceil \frac{2n}{3} \rceil$$

## 🔐 3. The Cryptographic Layer (ZK-Membrane)
To ensure **Privacy by Abstraction**, the raw score $S$ is never transmitted on-chain.

### Groth16 Arithmetic Circuit
The circuit $C(w, x)$ with private witnesses $w$ and public threshold $x$ enforces:
$$f(w, x) = (S - x) \cdot (1 - B) = 0$$
Where $B$ is the binary compliance bit.

This ensures that the blockchain only records the **fact of compliance**, never the private telemetry.

## ⚙️ 4. Protocol Architecture (HAAS)
The system operates in a three-tier hierarchy:
1.  **Strategic Core**: Orchestrates the workflow and triggers the consensus (Chainlink CRE).
2.  **Specialist Nuclei**: Specialized agents (Sentinel, Themis, Seve) that ingest and validate specific data domains.
3.  **Execution Layer**: Mints credentials (NFTs) and bridges state (CCIP).
